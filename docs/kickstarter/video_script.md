LaChart — 90s Kickstarter Video Script

0–5s — Hook
On-screen: Athlete + graph overlay. Voiceover: "Lactate testing is powerful — but messy. Spreadsheets, manual curves, guesswork."

5–20s — Problem
VO: "Coaches and athletes struggle to turn lactate samples into clear thresholds (LT1, LT2) and actionable zones."
Cut: chaotic notes, inconsistent charts.

20–40s — Solution (LaChart)
VO: "LaChart turns your test data into a clean lactate curve in seconds and calculates thresholds with multiple validated methods: OBLA, Dmax, IAT, log–log, LTP1/LTP2."
On-screen: app demo — input steps → curve → thresholds.

40–60s — Benefits
VO: "See zones instantly, compare historical tests, and share results with your team. For running, cycling, and swimming."
On-screen: zones cards, comparison, coach workspace.

60–80s — Social proof + Vision
VO: "Built with coaches. Designed for clarity. Our goal: make lactate testing accessible beyond labs, without sacrificing rigor."
On-screen: testimonials snippets, clean UI shots.

80–90s — Ask / CTA
