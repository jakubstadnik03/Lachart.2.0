LaChart — Lactate Curve Analyzer & Threshold Calculator

1) Introduction
LaChart is a modern web app that turns lactate test data into a clean curve and precise thresholds (LT1/LTP1, LT2/LTP2) using multiple methods (OBLA, Dmax, IAT, log–log). For athletes, coaches, and teams.

**The app is already built and I use it daily in my own training.** This Kickstarter campaign will fund improvements, bug fixes, and scaling for wider use.

2) The Problem
Lactate testing is powerful but fragmented: spreadsheets, manual charts, inconsistent methods. Coaches lose time; athletes don’t get actionable zones.

3) The Solution
With LaChart you can:
- Input test steps and instantly visualize the lactate–intensity curve
- Calculate LT1/LT2 using several validated methods
- Generate training zones for running, cycling, swimming
- Compare historical tests and track progress
- Share results with athletes/teams

4) How It Works
- Enter your test stages: power/pace, HR, lactate
- App fits the curve and applies 5 methods (OBLA, Dmax, IAT, log–log, thresholds)
- Zones are created automatically with context

5) What We're Building (Roadmap)
**Current Status:** Working app with core features (lactate curve analysis, threshold calculation, training zones). I use it daily for my own training.

**Kickstarter Goals:**
- Polish & bug fixes based on user feedback
- Coach workspace & athlete management
- PDF exports & improved charts
- Better mobile experience
- Import integrations (where APIs allow)
- Stretch: advanced analytics, team features

6) Rewards
See rewards.md — Early Bird, Lifetime, Coach/Team tiers, and enterprise partner options.

7) Timeline
- Month 0: Campaign ends — app is already functional, immediate access for backers
- Month 1–2: Polish based on feedback, bug fixes, new features
- Month 3: Enhanced v1.0 with coach features, deliver all reward codes

8) Budget
Development, design, infrastructure/hosting, email, support, contingency (10–15%).

9) Who We Are
Hi, I'm Jakub Stádník, a 22-year-old software engineering student and professional triathlete. My IRONMAN personal best is 8:00:45, and I'm currently competing at the professional level.

I created LaChart because I was frustrated with the lack of tools for lactate testing in my own training. As a triathlete, I rely heavily on lactate testing to optimize my performance, but I found myself drowning in spreadsheets and manual calculations. There was no simple way to track my lactate progress over time or share meaningful data with my coach.

**So I built it myself.** LaChart is already working—I use it daily in my training. The app calculates my lactate thresholds, tracks my progress, and helps me make data-driven training decisions.

The idea came from my own pain point: I wanted to use lactate testing data effectively, but existing solutions were either too complex for regular use or too basic to provide real insights. I needed something that could turn raw test data into actionable training zones quickly and accurately.

This isn't just a software project for me—it's born from real experience in the sport. I understand the frustration of coaches who want to provide the best guidance to their athletes but struggle with data management. I've been there, both as an athlete and as someone who's worked with coaches on lactate testing protocols.

**Now I want to share this tool with the community and make it even better.** This Kickstarter will fund improvements, new features, and scaling for wider use.

10) Risks & Mitigations
- Data accuracy: multi-method cross-checks, transparent assumptions
- Scalability: cloud hosting with monitoring
- Privacy: GDPR-first approach, minimal PII, clear policies
- Feature dependencies: staged delivery; where APIs are restricted, we offer CSV/GPX imports as fallback

11) Call to Action
Back LaChart and help bring accessible, rigorous lactate analysis to athletes everywhere.
